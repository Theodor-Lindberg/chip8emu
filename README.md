# chip8emu

This is an emulator for [CHIP-8][chip8] written in C++ with the C library [SDL][sdl] for graphics.

*CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. 
It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. 
CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine.*

## Developement environment
I'm using Visual Studio as developement environment, but in the future I maybe create a Makefile or CMake if I want to use Linux.
